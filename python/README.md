# 3
Hypothesis tests and Monte Carlo random sampling Confidence/credibility intervals and sorting algorithms

- Get the example of one of the Random class files

- Add a new method to the "Random" class to generate random numbers according to a distribution that is not already implemented. 
- This could be ex. a Categorical distribution (like a > 2-sided dice), or some other distribution (see Sec. 7.3 in the Random Number Generation reading from Numerical Methods for some code examples)

- Make a plot of numbers sampled using your new method

# 4

Add code to calculate different quantiles from sorted arrays of outcomes

Add code to visualize the distribution of outcomes stored in the input file you pass to the program (generated using CookieTimer.py or CookieTimer.x)

# Random
Added normal distribution method.
Completed 3.py with categorical distribution.
I changed CoinToss to use categorical distribution.
